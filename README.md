# AWS-Scripts

aws_creation_script - creates an EC2 instance on AWS, then creates and attaches (to same instance) an EBS Storage (5GB), then allocates and associates an elastic ip address, creates a security group to allow SSH & HTTP, and a keypair file to allow connecting to the instance once complete.
